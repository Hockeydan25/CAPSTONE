# Write a program that turns a sentence into camel case. 
# The first word is lowercase, the rest of the words have their initial letter capitalized, 
# and all of the words are joined together. For example, with the input "fOnt proCESSOR and ParsER", 
# your program will output "fontProcessorAndParser".
